pChart 2.2 library for PHP 7
===================

The good old pChart got an overhaul!

For a compatible version, please check the "7-Compatible" branch:
 - All examples work fine with zero code modifications to them
 - Code was beautified
 - Made minor improvements and added some speed ups
 
The master branch contains a version that will NOT work with your existing code.
Although I am not yet happy with the way it looks, so much work went in there that I decided to post it.
Please check the change log for the complete list of changes.
The sandbox and all examples work as expected.
